		<h3>History of accounting</h3>
		The history of accounting has been around almost as long as money itself. Accounting history dates back to ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Babylon. For example, during <time datetime="1100">the Roman Empire</time>, the government had detailed records of its finances. However, modern accounting as a profession has only been around since the <time datetime="1800">early 19th century</time>.<b>Luca Pacioli</b> is considered <blockquote>"The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping"</blockquote> due to his contributions to the development of accounting as a profession.

		<h3>The accounting rules</h3>
		<p>In most cases, accountants use generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) when preparing financial statements in the U.S. GAAP is a set of standards and principles designed to improve the comparability and consistency of financial reporting across industries. Its standards are based on double-entry accounting, a method in which every accounting transaction is entered as both a debit and credit in two separate general ledger accounts that will roll up into the balance sheet and income statement.
		</p>
		<h3>The accounting cycle</h3>
		<p>Financial accountants typically operate in a cyclical environment with the same steps happening in order and repeating every reporting period. These steps are often referred to as the accounting cycle, the process of taking raw transaction information, entering it into an accounting system, and running relevant and accurate financial reports.
